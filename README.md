# Project-1-Grub

## Description
Grub is an app where like-minded individuals who have a passion for cooking can showcase and share their favourite recipes. Its aim is to provide homecooks with a place where they can collaborate on recipe ideas, provide ideas for improvement or suggestions for recipe changes. It covers a wide variety of audiences who hold a common desire - cooking!

## Installation

Once successfully logged in you will find the Grub homepage (../html/home.html) showing navigation to the four (4) recipe categories: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert that you can click on to go to the recipe category. Additionally, you will find the navigation bar at the top that you can also use to navigate to My Recipes, My Favourite Recipes, and the Fellow Grubs - where you can invite your friends to try the Grub app an make their own contributions or connect with existing Grub app account holders (i.e. Fellow Grubs).

When you click on a Recipe Category you will find a selection of recipes for that specified category, for example the recipe category for desserts (../html/dessert_specific_page.html). You also have the opportunity to Add Your Own recipe to the Recipe Category by clicking on the "Add My Dish" button.
